# Portfolio Page

## Description

Page that showcases my most recent work. Itis made up of three sections: About me, Work and Contact me. 

"About me" contains a short description and my picture. 

"Work" is made up of five sections, each set up with placeholder text and a picture that will link to one of my deployed pages (no links as of now but will be updated as projects are added). 

"Contact me" contains links to my contact details.

This page is responsive.
